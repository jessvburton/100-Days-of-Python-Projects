# 100-Days-of-Python-Projects

The following projects have been created while following the *'100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp'* course on Udemy.
I like to add to this repository as a way to practise and refresh my Python skills (which is why it spans over 100 days).
This includes, but is not limited to, Python 3, object-oriented programming (OOP), automation and scripting, game development, and basic GUI applications.
