# Our Blackjack House Rules

- The deck is unlimited in size. 
- There are no jokers. 
- The Jack/Queen/King all count as 10.
- The the Ace can count as 11 or 1.
- Use the following list as the deck of cards:
- cards = [11, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 10, 10, 10]
- The cards in the list have equal probability of being drawn.
- Cards are not removed from the deck as they are drawn.
- The computer is the dealer.

For this challenge I first attempted it without using any of the hints. By doing it this way I learnt a lot and faced many challenges, some which I overcame, others I did not. The code runs, but does not follow all of the house rules. For my second attempt, I used the hints provided and completed the challenge fairly quickly. Seeing the different ways the code can be compiled was very educational and helpful.
